 the problems faced was how to initiate the function at a future time but that problem was solved by calculating the time difference between now and
 that future date using moment and then adding the delay from the text as well apart from that it was a stright-forward problem which i enjoyed doing.

i have also used moment as i mentioned extensively to handle the dates and setTimeout function to handle the delay.
